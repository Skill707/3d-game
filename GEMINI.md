## Gemini AI Integration

This document outlines the integration of Gemini AI into the 3D game project.

### Overview

The Gemini AI will be used for:
- **Dynamic NPC behavior:** NPCs will exhibit more intelligent and adaptive behaviors based on game state and player interaction.
- **Procedural content generation:** Generating quests, dialogues, or even environmental elements on the fly.
- **Enhanced narrative:** Creating more engaging and personalized storytelling experiences.

### Integration Steps

1.  **API Key Management:** Securely store and manage the Gemini AI API key. Consider using environment variables or a dedicated configuration file that is not committed to version control.

2.  **API Client Setup:**
    -   Install the necessary Gemini AI client library (e.g., `google-generative-ai` if using Node.js).
    -   Initialize the client with the API key.

3.  **Function Calling (if applicable):**
    -   Define tools or functions that Gemini AI can call to interact with the game's systems (e.g., `spawn_item`, `update_quest_status`, `move_npc`).
    -   Implement the actual logic for these functions within the game's codebase.

4.  **Prompt Engineering:**
    -   Design effective prompts to guide Gemini AI's responses and actions.
    -   Consider using few-shot learning by providing examples in the prompt.
    -   Structure prompts to include relevant game context (player location, NPC state, quest objectives).

5.  **Response Handling:**
    -   Parse and interpret Gemini AI's responses.
    -   Implement logic to translate AI-generated text or function calls into in-game actions.
    -   Handle potential errors or unexpected responses from the AI.
